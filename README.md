## Supplementary materials for STA261 Summer 2018 at University of Toronto

This site contains supplementary materials for STA261, Probability & Statistics II, Summer 2018 at the University of Toronto taught by Alex Stringer. Materials include code examples, simulations, data anlaysis and more, to enhance the understanding of theoretical calculations and analytic examples done in lecture and on assignments. Some of these examples may be covered directly in lectures, while others are for your own self-study. Nothing on this site is **mandatory**; all assignments and official instructor communication still happens through [Quercus](http://q.utoronto.ca)
